It predicts whether the person has diabetes or not.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes data from 768 women with 8 characteristics, in particular:
1. Number of times pregnant
2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. Diabetes pedigree function
8. Age (years)
The last column of the dataset indicates if the person is affected (1) by diabetes or not (0).

The type of dataset and problem is a classic supervised binary classification. Given a number of elements all with certain characteristics (features), we want to build a machine learning model to identify people affected by diabetes.

To solve the problem we will have to analyse the data, do any required transformation and normalisation, apply a machine learning algorithm, train a model, check the performance of the trained model and iterate with other algorithms until we find the most performant for our type of dataset.
